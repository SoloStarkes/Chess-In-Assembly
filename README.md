# Chess-In-Assembly
We want to recreate playing a game of chess. It will be a 2 player game that is played by gathering user inputs from 2 different people, the operations being performed would be the chess moves, and the output would be an updated board. We will need to figure out how to add sprites to show each piece and have the two players be black and white, respectively. There will be a message at the start of the game and a message at the end of the game to show what player wins or if the match ends in a stalemate. We may also include a resign button and the en passant move if we have the time.
